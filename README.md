# Project-1-BlackJack-Game

This project is a simple game of BlackJack. I made this game because I thought it would challenge me to work on items that I struggled with in class.

Wire Frame:




User Story:

As a user, I should be able to start a new game

As a user, I should be able to see what cards I have

As a user, I should be able to see the dealers cards on the table

As a user I should be able to use buttons “Hit” and “stay”

As a user I should be shown a message/alert when I “win”, “bust”, or “tie”

As a user, I should be able to view the rules of the game at anytime

As a user, I should be given the option to “keep playing” or “quit “


Technologies/Approaches Used:

I used vanilla javascript, html, css, and bootstrap for my rules modal.
I also used some great DRY coding techniques from some codepen.io users.
Establishing arrays for the cards, the player and dealer hands, and the call to get elements were key in achieving the basic gameplay .
Also utilizing functions and callbacks make the gameplay run smoothly.
The user has the choice to start the game, hit and stay with the help of the onclick Event Listeners.

The MDN docs were instrumental as well as w3chools.com for debugging and learning new methods

Un-solved Problems:
I was not able to input a betting system with a bank of funds
I was also unable to use the close button for my rulesModal.


forthcoming features:
-visual representation of the deck of cards with animation
-interactive win features
-betting for a true casino feel
-Adding more that one player to the gameplay
-input for player names
-split function for doubling and splitting Aces
